Metric Name	Description	
Derivation/Formula
Example
2
Performance	
Time taken by the system to respond to a user request (e.g., average page load time).
Measured in milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s). Average response time can be calculated over a defined period or for specific user actions.
The average response time for a login request is 2 seconds.
3
Throughput	
Number of transactions the system can handle per unit of time.
Measured in transactions per second (TPS) or similar units. Throughput can be measured under various load conditions.
The system can handle 1000 transactions per second during peak usage.
4
Resource Utilization
Measures how efficiently the system utilizes resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth (e.g., CPU usage percentage).
Measured as a percentage of available resources used.
CPU usage during peak load is typically around 70%.
5
Usability			
6
Task Completion Time
Time taken by users to complete a specific task within the software.
Measured in seconds or minutes. Average task completion time can be calculated for various user groups and tasks.
The average time it takes users to complete a purchase is 3 minutes.
7
Error Rate	
Percentage of times users encounter errors while using the software.
Calculated as the number of errors divided by the total number of user actions, multiplied by 100%.
The error rate for searching products is 5%.
8
User Satisfaction Surveys
Gather feedback from users on their experience with the software's ease of use.
Conducted through surveys or interviews. Analyze responses to identify usability issues.
User satisfaction surveys reveal difficulty navigating the checkout process.
9
Security			
10
Number of Vulnerabilities Identified
Tracks the number of security vulnerabilities discovered during testing.
The total count of vulnerabilities identified through various security testing techniques.
10 security vulnerabilities were identified during penetration testing.
11
Penetration Testing Results
Measures the effectiveness of security controls against simulated attacks.
Analyzes the outcome of penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.
Penetration testing revealed a vulnerability allowing unauthorized access.
12
Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)
The average time it takes to restore system functionality after a security breach.
Calculated as the total downtime after a security breach divided by the number of breaches.
The MTTR for security breaches is typically within 4 hours.
13
Reliability			
14
Uptime Percentage
Percentage of time the system is operational and accessible to users.
Calculated as the total uptime divided by the total monitoring period, multiplied by 100%.
The system uptime for the past month was 99.5%.
15
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
Average time between system failures.
Calculated as the total uptime divided by the number of failures during that period.
The MTBF for the server is 24 hours.
16
Defect Escape Rate
The percentage of defects that remain undetected after testing and reach production.
Calculated as the number of defects found in production divided by the total number of defects identified during testing, multiplied by 100%.
The defect escape rate for this release is 2%.
17
Scalability			
18
Time to Scale	
The time it takes for the system to adapt to increased user load or data volume.
Measured in minutes or hours.
The system can scale to handle additional users within 10 minutes.
19
Performance Under Load
Measures how well the system performs under increased load conditions.
Measured through performance metrics like response time and throughput under simulated load scenarios.
System performance remains stable under increased load with minimal response time increase.
20
Compatibility			
21
Number of Supported Platforms
Tracks the number of operating systems and devices the software is compatible with.
Maintained list of compatible platforms through testing on various systems.
The software is compatible with Windows 10, macOS 12, and major mobile phone operating systems.
22
Compatibility Testing Results
Measures how well the software functions on different platforms and browsers.
Analyzes functionality and performance across various platforms and browsers.
Compatibility testing revealed a minor display issue on a specific browser version, which will be addressed.
